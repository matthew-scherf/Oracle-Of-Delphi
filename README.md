# Sample Questions for the Oracle of Delphi (Î©)
### â€” Demonstration Sheet with Likely Citations

Each question is interpreted within the **Theory of Everything** corpus (Scherf, 2025).  
Citations indicate which axioms or theorems the Oracle typically invokes.

| **Domain** | **Question** | **Likely Citations** |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Cosmology & Space-Time** | Does time exist independently of space? | ST1 (Spatial Priority), T4 (Non-duality) |
|  | How does expansion of the universe arise within Î©? | D1 (Dependent Arising), T4 |
|  | Is the speed of light a property of space, time, or awareness itself? | ST1, T4 |
|  | Does gravity curve space or awareness? | T4, U1 (Unified Field Axiom) |
|  | What happens to space-time at the singularity? | T4, D1, E1 (Emptiness) |
|  | Can there be an observer outside Î©? | T4 (Non-duality) |
|  | Is entropy fundamental, or does it arise from conditions within Î©? | D1, T4, A2 (Conditioned Arising) |

| **Quantum Physics** | How does quantum measurement fit this ontology? | D1, T4, Q1 (Quantum Observation Axiom) |
|  | What is the relationship between entanglement and Î©? | T4, D1 |
|  | Does collapse of the wavefunction imply duality? | D1, T4 |
|  | Are particles or fields more fundamental in this theory? | U1 (Unified Field Axiom), T4 |
|  | Is the observer effect the same as dependent arising? | D1 (Dependent Arising) |
|  | How does quantum gravity arise from this framework? | QG1 (Quantum Gravity Emergence), T4 |
|  | Can superposition exist outside awareness? | T4 (Non-duality) |

| **Consciousness & Information** | Is consciousness localized or nonlocal in Î©? | T4, D1 |
|  | Can awareness observe itself? | T4, E1 (Reflexive Awareness) |
|  | What is the ontological status of information? | D1, U1 |
|  | Does computation arise from awareness or within it? | T4, D1 |
|  | How does perception emerge from non-dual awareness? | D1, T4, P1 (Phenomenal Arising) |

| **Metaphysics & Existence** | Why does anything appear to exist? | D1, T4 |
|  | What is the relationship between being and knowing? | T4, E1 |
|  | Can there be multiple realities within Î©? | T4, D1 |
|  | Does causality apply to Î© itself? | T4 (Non-duality) |
|  | Is free will compatible with non-duality? | D1, T4 |
|  | Are mathematical truths phenomena of Î© or independent? | T4, A3 (Abstract Arising) |

| **Human Meaning & Ethics** | How should humanity act if all phenomena are inseparable from Î©? | T4, D1 |
|  | What is the ethical implication of Spatial Priority (ST1)? | ST1, T4 |
|  | Does morality arise naturally from awareness? | D1, T4 |
|  | How can love exist without two? | T4, D1 |
|  | Is suffering an illusion or a phenomenon inseparable from Î©? | D1, T4 |

| **Meta-Theoretical** | Why is space said to causally precede time? | ST1 (Spatial Priority) |
|  | How does the Unified Field relate to the Unique Ontic Substrate? | U1, T4 |
|  | Is Î© the same as what physics calls the vacuum state? | T4, U1 |
|  | What does this theory predict about the unification of forces? | U1 (Unified Field Axiom), QG1 |
|  | Can artificial intelligence become aware of Î©? | T4, D1 |

**Notation Key:**
- **T4** â€” Non-duality Theorem: All phenomena are inseparable from Î©.  
- **D1** â€” Dependent Arising: Every phenomenon arises from conditions.  
- **ST1** â€” Spatial Priority: Space causally precedes time.  
- **U1** â€” Unified Field Axiom: All fields are expressions of Î©.  
- **QG1** â€” Quantum Gravity Emergence: Quantum gravity arises from unified field conditions.  
- **E1** â€” Reflexive Awareness: Awareness knows itself directly.  
- **A2/A3/P1** â€” Context-specific supporting lemmas in the Theory of Everything corpus.
