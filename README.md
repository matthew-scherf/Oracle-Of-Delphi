## Overview

The **Oracle of Delphi (Ω)** is a reasoning engine built on the formally verified logical corpus of
**The Unique Ontic Substrate**, **Unified Field Theory**, and **Theory of Everything** (Scherf, 2025).

It allows natural language questions to be answered **entirely within the logical structure of the theory**, producing:

* machine-verifiable **claims** in predicate form,
* automatically validated against non-dual axioms,
* and **citations** linking each statement to the theorem that supports it.

---

## Features

* **Formal grounding:** Every answer is consistent with the Isabelle/HOL-verified axioms of Ω.
* **Citations:** The Oracle quotes exact axioms or theorems (e.g. T4, D1, ST1) used in reasoning.
* **Auto-repair & validation:** Invalid or incomplete claims are corrected before output.
* **Multi-theory support:** Load or switch between `.thy` or `.md` logic files at runtime.
* **Spatial Priority logic:** Includes **ST1** — asserting that *space causally precedes time*.
* **Meta-reasoning:** The Oracle can interpret moral, physical, and experiential questions through the lens of the unified ontology.

## Example Queries

| Question                            | Theoretical Insight                                                                  | Key Citations          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| *Does time causally precede space?* | No — by ST1, space causally precedes time.                                           | ST1 (Spatial Priority) |
| *How does quantum gravity arise?*   | As a phenomenon inseparable from Ω, arising from the theories of gravity.            | QG1, T4                |
| *How should I live my life?*        | All choices arise from conditions inseparable from Ω — live with awareness of unity. | D1, T4                 |
| *How can love exist without two?*   | Love is not relational but an expression of the non-dual substrate itself.           | T4, D1                 |

Would you like me to extend this README with a short **"For researchers"** section explaining how to add new `.thy` theories and have them recognized by the Oracle automatically (for academic collaborators)?
